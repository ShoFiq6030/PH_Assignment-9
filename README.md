## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is the result of my assignment numberâ€¯9, created with React and Vite. The application was scaffolded using the official React + Vite template, and demonstrates frontend routing, state management, component architecture and other foundational React features.

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- React (JSX, functional components, hooks)
- Vite (fast build & development environment)
- ESLint for code style & linting
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Nodeâ€¯/â€¯npm for package management

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Here is a breakdown of the main folders and files:

```
/images              â†’ asset images used in the application
/public              â†’ static files and the main `index.html`
/src                 â†’ source code (components, pages, etc)
.gitignore           â†’ files to ignore in version control
package.json         â†’ project metadata & dependencies
vite.config.js       â†’ Vite configuration
eslint.config.js     â†’ linting rules
README.md            â†’ this documentation
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShoFiq6030/PH_Assignment-9.git
   cd PH_Assignment-9
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the displayed local URL (e.g., https://ph-assignment-9-a1152.web.app/) to view the app.

5. For building the project for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## âœ… Features

- Fast development using Viteâ€™s hotâ€‘module reloading
- Structured React component architecture
- ESLint integrated for maintaining code quality
- Easy to extend: add new pages, components or routing as needed

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements

- Add state management (e.g., Redux, Context API) for larger scale
- Implement routing guards or private routes
- Integrate backend or API for dynamic data
- Add unit/integration tests (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Expand styling/theme (CSSâ€‘inâ€‘JS, Tailwind, etc)
